# GlobalTeam

GlobalTeam aims to be an international collaboration and video chat tool that helps international users schedule accross timezones while learning the geography and news updates of their respective regions to facilitate ease of management and group cohesion.

## Tech stack
For now the plan is to use T3 with Prisma/Supabase, either Mapbox or Leaflet, or WebRTC. The project is grand in scope but is meant to be a beginner-friendly learning project, and so features will be developed one at a time.
